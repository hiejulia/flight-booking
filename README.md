### Run the project 

+ Run everything : 



+ `docker-compose up` : RabbitMQ port set up (in the docker folder) : it will start the RabbitMQ and MongoDB instance 

java -jar eureka-server/target/eureka-server.jar  : Start Eureke server  -  Eureka server port set up
java -jar dashboard-server/target/dashboard-server.jar : Start Hystrix dashboard - Hystrix port set up 
java -jar turbine-server/target/turbine-server.jar 

java -jar flight-service/target/restaurant-service.jar 
java -jar user-service/target/user-service.jar 
java -jar booking-service/target/booking-service.jar 
java -jar api-service/target/api-service.jar

+ Before start Zuul service, make sure that all of the services are up in the Eureka dashboad : `localhost:8761`
java -jar zuul-server/target/zuul-server.jar 



+ How to double check all components are setting up 
1. Browser : Eureka server 
`http://localhost:8761/`
Service instances are register with Eureka 


2. Browser : Hystrix monitor : `http://localhost:7979/ ` - Hystrix dashboard 
+ Substitude : [http://hostname:port/turbine/turbine.stream] to
                    URL:  http://localhost:9001/hystrix.stream
         --> Monitor Stream

3. Browser : RabbitMQ management : `http://localhost:15672/` (guest- guest )



+ Install and run 
    + MongoDB : `docker run --name mongo -p 27017:27017 -d mongo`
    + Redis : `dockewr run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis`

### Microservice architecture 
+ Service discovery and registration - Eureka 
    + Run multiple instances of the same microservices
    + Look up the host name and the port number by checking discovery service 
    + Eureka server : `http://localhost:8761/`
    + Advanced discovery client config 
    + Enable secure communication between client and server
    + Config failover and peer - to - peer replication mechanism 
    + Register instances of client - side application in different zones 
    + Cluster env : zone mechanism - enable zone handling 
    + Replication and high availability - cluster mechanism - peer to peer replication model - replication mechanism 
    + Run instances of Eureka 
    + Enable secure communication between client and server 
        + Register a secure service 
        + Enable SSL by generating a self - signed certificate 
        + SSL is enabled for edge-service only 

+ Config service   
    + Application configuration to all the other microservices 
    + Port number, context paths 
    + Configuration - using GIT 
    + Vault - cmd - add new values to the server - run from docker container 

+ Edge or proxy server (API gateway) - Zuul - Gateway service 
    + Gateway service Zuul 
    + Proxy all calls to the target microservice 
    + Solve CORS request - Enable CORS headers on the proxy only
    + Zuul integrates with Eureka (discovery-service)
    + Gateway service that provides dynamic routing, monitor, resiliency, security 
+ Load balancing : Ribbon is used for load balancing . It is integrated with the Zuul and Eureka services to provide load balancing for both internal and external calls 
    + Server side load balancing : Zuul server as edge server 
    + Client side load balancing : Ribbon - FeignClient 
+ Circuit breaker : Netflix hystrix 
+ Distributed tracing : Zipkin, Spring Cloud Sleuth - distributed tracing via logs - distributed tracing system with request visualization 
    + tracing mechanism 
    + trace and span ID 
    + record time - latency analysis - statistics = zipkin = query and visualize data 
    + stream = producer of message sent to message broker 
+ Monitoring : Netflix Turbine  - and Dashboard 
    + Hystrix provides a dashboard UI `locahost:7979`
    + Turbine stream `http://localhost:8989/turbine.stream`
    + Hystrix uses RabbitMQ to send metrics data feed to Turbine 
    + Config and collect metrics and tracing from all services
+ UUA servvice 
    + User account & Authentication - security of the application 
    + /token endpoint to retrieve a token 
    + /user endpoint to validate a token and retrieve the user and its roles
    + Token in this case are long-lived 

+ Integration
+ Batch processing 
+ Security service 
    + Secure microservices architecture 
    + SSL enabled 

+ Dependency management : Maven 
+ Data Lake 
+ Testing microservices
    + Deploy all of them and test them in an end-to-end fashion 
    + Mock external dependencies in unit/integration test 
    
+ Event sourcing 
+ HTTP listener 
+ Containers / Virtual Machines 
+ Cluster Control and Provisioning 

+ Admin server 

+ Spring cloud DataFlow server 
    + `dataflow-service` is a Spring Boot app that loads the local DataFlow server. Port 9393
    + To interact with the dataflow server, you can donw

    2. `docker run -d -it --name kibanak --link es:elasticsearch -p 5601:5601 kibana` : start Kibana on 5601 port and it will also link it with ElasticSearch container 
    3. `docker run -d -it --name logstash -p 5000:5000 logstash -e 'input { tcp { port => 5000 codec => "json" } } output { elasticsearch { hosts => ["192.168.99.100"] index => "micro-%{serviceName}"} }'` : start Logstash container on 5000 port and also create an index with name micro-*
    4. Checking with `docker ps` command, all the container should be running 
    + Default port used for docker container is 192.168.99.100 

    + Kibana : check logs on Kibana

    + Database : MongoDB 
    + User search for flight based on search query 
+ Catalog service 

+ User service - Account service 
    + User/ Customer register account
    + Database : MySQL 
+ Account service 
+ Booking service 
    + Database : MongoDB 
    + User book the flight and fill needed information for the flight

    + Dabase : RDBMS 
    + User pay for flight ticket 

+ Subscription service 
    + Use
+ Route service 
    + User search for flight by flight route and flight city
+ Notification service 
    + Notification is send to user when user book a flight 
+ Ticker order service : before book for ticker, user can choose to order (reserve the flight ticker in a certain of time )
+ Payment service : After sending bill to user(customer), payment service is used for pay the fee of the flight ticket 
+ third party payment service 

+ Credit risk engine :  
    + Service to test for the validity of the bank account 
    










### Other 
#### How to deploy in AWS 
+ Create folder for each microservice(except flightsearchclient) project in AWS AMI root folder(e.g "eureka")
+ Copy the corresponding jar and the dockerfile in that folder (e.g "eurekaserver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" and "Dockerfile" )
+ Go to that directory from root and run docker build command to create docker image("cd eureka","sudo docker build -t eureka .")
+ Go to root directory and run docker compose command("sudo docker-compose up")
+ To stop run "sudo docker-compose down"






### Microservices architecture 
#### Debug tools 
+ Curl and jq
